  Currently, the seed data for Israeli railway stations is specified in the `OnModelCreating` method of the `RailwayDbContext` using the `.HasData` method. To follow the best practices and achieve better separation of concerns, the seed data should be moved to a dedicated database creation script. This involves:

  1. Removing the `.HasData` call for stations in `RailwayDbContext`.
  2. Writing a new SQL script to insert the station data into the `Station` table.
  3. Integrating the script with the database initialization process to be applied during database provisioning.

  The new approach will enable better modularity, environment-specific setups, and remove dependency on Entity Framework migrations for data seeding.
